#  PURPOSE: To create a medical diagnosis robot that diagnoses a 
#           patientâ€™s state of dehydration based on a short questionnaire
#           given and prints out list of all saved patients and their 
#           diagnosis.

#  METHOD: 

# string that welcomes doctor and asks whether or not to list all patients
    #  to run a new diagnosis or to quit program
welcome_prompt = "Welcome doctor! What would you like to do today?\n - To list all patients, press 1\n - To run a new diagnosis, press 2\n - To quit, press q\n"

# asking for name of the doctor
doctors_prompt = "What is name of the doctor seeing the patient?\n"

#asking for name of the patient
patient_prompt= "What is the name of the patient?\n"

# prompt asking if patient is normal or lethargic 
appearance_prompt = "How is the patient's general appearance?\n - If normal appearance, press 1\n - If irritable or lethargic, press 2\n"

#prompt asking if patient's eyes are normal or very sunken
eye_prompt = "How are the patient's eyes?\n - If eyes normal or slightly sunken, press 1\n - If eyes very sunken, press 2\n"

# prompt asking if patient's skin patch is normal or slow
skin_prompt = "How is the patient's skin when you pinch it?\n - If skin patch is normal, press 1\n - If skin pinch is slow, press 2\n"

# if incorrect inputs 
error_message = "Could not save patient and diagnosis due to invalid input"

# string variables
